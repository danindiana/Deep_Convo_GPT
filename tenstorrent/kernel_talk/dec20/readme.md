Tenstorrent Wormhole Series Part 3: NoC propagation delay
Posted at corsix.org on September 8, 2024
Continuing the trend from part 2 of eschewing the useful software layers provided by Tenstorrent, and instead manually poking around in various address spaces, every T tile contains a 64-bit counter at tile-local address 0xFFB121F0 and 0xFFB121F8 which starts at zero when the chip is powered on, and increments by one every clock cycle. Every T tile also contains a soft-reset register at tile-local address 0xFFB121B0; if this register contains 0x47800 then all five Baby RISC-V cores are held in soft reset, and then individual bits can be cleared to take individual cores out of soft reset (i.e. allow them to run).

With these two pieces of information, we can do something interesting: use a NoC multicast write to take one core out of reset on every tile, have RISC-V code on every tile record its cycle counter somewhere as soon as it comes out of reset, then collect and plot the results.

In order to start from a clean slate, we'll want to use a NoC multicast write to put all cores into soft-reset, specifying (0, 0) through (9, 11) inclusive as the multicast rectangle, and relying on the multicast disable row/column we saw in part 2 to ensure that the multicast only goes to T tiles:

#define RV_ADDR_SOFT_RESET 0xFFB121B0

#define SOFT_RESET_ALL_CORES 0x47800

char* reg_tlb = set_tlb(dev, TLB_IDX_UC0, TLB_CFG_MULTICAST(0, 0, 9, 11), RV_ADDR_SOFT_RESET);
*(volatile uint32_t*)(reg_tlb + RV_ADDR_SOFT_RESET) = SOFT_RESET_ALL_CORES;
With all the cores held in soft-reset, it is safe to send them new code. The SRAM (or, for D tiles, DRAM) within a tile starts at tile-local address 0, and execution will also start at address 0 when soft-reset is cleared, so we can send some RISC-V code to tile-local addresses starting at 0, again multicasting it out. The code will read from the tile-local 64-bit cycle counter at 0xFFB121F0 and 0xFFB121F8, then write it to tile-local address 128:

const uint32_t rv_code[] = {
  0xFFB12537, // lui a0, 0xFFB12
  0x1F052583, // lw a1, 0x1F0(a0)
  0x1F852603, // lw a2, 0x1F8(a0)
  0x08B02023, // sw a1, 128(x0)
  0x08C02223, // sw a2, 132(x0)
  0x0000006F, // loop: j loop
};
char* l1_tlb = set_tlb(dev, TLB_IDX_0, TLB_CFG_MULTICAST(0, 0, 9, 11), 0);
memcpy(l1_tlb, rv_code, sizeof(rv_code));
We can then perform a multicast to bring one core out of reset on each T tile:

*(volatile uint32_t*)(reg_tlb + RV_ADDR_SOFT_RESET) = SOFT_RESET_ALL_CORES & (SOFT_RESET_ALL_CORES - 1);
We can't use multicast to collect the results - instead we need to perform a unicast read against each T tile in turn. That requires knowing the tile coordinates of each T tile, and said grid isn't entirely regular: it'll be disturbed by a column of D tiles, and be disturbed by a row of E tiles, and have one or two disabled rows. We can sidestep this problem by using a convenient translation feature: an X coordinate of 16 will be replaced with 0 (PCIe / ARC / D column), 17 will be replaced with 5 (2nd D column), then 18 through 25 will be replaced with the column indices containing T tiles. Similarly, a Y coordinate of 16 will be replaced with 0 (E0-E7 row), 17 will be replaced with 6 (E8-E15 row), and 18 through 25 or 26 will be replaced with whatever row indices contain active T tiles (if you need a reminder of the coordinate grid, see part 1). This allows us to easily iterate over the active T tiles:

uint64_t times[8][8];
for (uint32_t y = 0; y < 8; ++y) {
  for (uint32_t x = 0; x < 8; ++x) {
    l1_tlb = set_tlb(dev, TLB_IDX_0, TLB_CFG_UNICAST(18 + x, 18 + y), 0);
    times[y][x] = *(volatile uint64_t*)(l1_tlb + 128);
  }
}
For neatness, we can then put everything back into reset:

*(volatile uint32_t*)(reg_tlb + RV_ADDR_SOFT_RESET) = SOFT_RESET_ALL_CORES;
With T denoting the minimum value seen in the times matrix, I observe:



If instead multicasting via NoC #1 (by adding TLB_CFG_NOC1 to the TLB_CFG_MULTICAST result), and calling S the minimum value seen this time, I observe:



Both sets of measurements suggest that the tile-to-tile propagation delay might be around 9 cycles, but the numbers are far from perfect. The imperfections are very clear if we plot both sets of measurements at the same time, and look at just the row containing the PCIe tile:



Going rightwards, the first tile is "T+3" and the last is "T+75", meaning 72 cycles to traverse 8 tiles. Going leftwards, the first tile is "S+0" and the last is "S+72", again meaning 72 cycles to traverse 8 tiles. However, going rightwards, the 2nd tile is "T+0", which isn't great: taken at face value it would mean that the multicast reached the 2nd tile before reaching the first, which is clearly nonsense. There is one obvious explanation for this: the cycle counters on different tiles aren't perfectly aligned - they're meant to all start from 0 when the chip powers on, but powering on is a physically complex process, so some tiles might start counting a few cycles before or after others.

If the tile-to-tile latency was identical for every hop, and we called this unknown quantity X, then what we'd hope to see is:



Regardless of what S or T or X actually are, it so happens that the average of the two expressions in each tile is (S + T)/2 + 4X. As this expression should be the same for all tiles, we can use it to correct for the different counter start times between the different tiles. We need to assume that there is a per-tile counter adjustment, with all readings taken on a given tile adjusted by the same amount, and then set those adjustments so that "should be the same" becomes "is the same". Because I'm lazy, I'll assume that all tiles within a given column have the same adjustment, which isn't quite true, but it'll do for now. After computing and applying this adjustment, the NoC #0 measurements are:



And NoC #1 are:



The results still aren't perfect, but they're good enough for me to conclude that the tile-to-tile propagation delay is 9 clock cycles (i.e. 9 nanoseconds when the clock is running at 1GHz), and that imperfections in measurements are due to the aforementioned laziness. For tile-to-tile communication there'll be some latency to get on to the NoC, then a propagation delay for every traversed tile, and then some latency to get off the NoC. For messages requiring a response, there'll be all that twice, as after the request has done all that, the response needs to get on to the NoC, then propagate back to the requestor, then get off the NoC. For NoC reads (and presumably NoC writes-with-acknowledgement, if you use them), that response travels on the same NoC as the request, so if requestee and respondee are in the same row, the combination of request and response will have 10 tiles (90 cycles) of propagation delay, versus 12 tiles (108 cycles) of propagation delay if they're in the same column, and 10+12 tiles (198 cycles) if they're in different row and column.

That wraps up part 3. The complete code comes out to 164 lines, but a lot of it is common with part 2's 100 lines. If you're reading along, part 4 is next.
This blog post delves into the intricacies of the Tenstorrent Wormhole architecture, specifically focusing on the Network-on-Chip (NoC) propagation delay. The author employs a hands-on approach, bypassing the higher-level software abstractions provided by Tenstorrent to directly manipulate hardware registers and observe the behavior of the chip. Here's a breakdown of the key points and methodologies discussed:

Key Concepts and Methodology
Cycle Counter and Soft-Reset Register:

Each T tile on the chip has a 64-bit cycle counter at tile-local addresses 0xFFB121F0 and 0xFFB121F8. This counter increments every clock cycle starting from zero when the chip is powered on.

A soft-reset register at tile-local address 0xFFB121B0 controls the reset state of the five Baby RISC-V cores on each tile. Writing 0x47800 to this register holds all cores in soft-reset, and individual bits can be cleared to release specific cores from reset.

Experiment Setup:

The experiment involves using NoC multicast writes to control the reset state of the cores and to load RISC-V code onto the tiles.

The RISC-V code reads the cycle counter and stores the value at a specific memory location (tile-local address 128).

Multicast and Unicast Operations:

Multicast Writes: Used to reset all cores and to load the RISC-V code onto multiple tiles simultaneously.

Unicast Reads: Used to collect the cycle counter values from each tile individually after the cores have been released from reset.

Tile Coordinate Translation:

The chip's tile grid is irregular due to the presence of D and E tiles and disabled rows/columns. The author uses a translation feature to simplify iterating over active T tiles by mapping specific X and Y coordinates to the actual tile indices.

Data Collection and Analysis:

The cycle counter values from each tile are collected and stored in a matrix.

The author observes discrepancies in the cycle counter values, which are attributed to the misalignment of cycle counters across different tiles due to the complex power-on process.

Adjustment and Correction:

To account for the misalignment, the author introduces a per-tile counter adjustment. This adjustment is calculated to normalize the cycle counter values across tiles.

After applying the adjustments, the author concludes that the tile-to-tile propagation delay is approximately 9 clock cycles (9 nanoseconds at a 1GHz clock frequency).

Observations and Conclusions
Propagation Delay: The experiment suggests that the NoC propagation delay between tiles is around 9 clock cycles.

Measurement Imperfections: The initial measurements show inconsistencies, which are corrected by adjusting for the misalignment of cycle counters across tiles.

NoC Latency: For tile-to-tile communication, there is additional latency for getting on and off the NoC, which must be considered in addition to the propagation delay.

Code and Implementation
The complete code for the experiment is provided, spanning 164 lines, with significant overlap with the code from part 2 of the series. The implementation involves setting up TLB configurations, performing multicast and unicast operations, and analyzing the collected data.

Future Work
The author hints at a continuation of this exploration in part 4, suggesting that there is more to uncover about the Tenstorrent Wormhole architecture and its NoC behavior.

This detailed analysis provides valuable insights into the low-level operation of the Tenstorrent chip, highlighting both the capabilities and the challenges of working with complex hardware architectures.

Key Points in the Pseudo Code:
TLB Configuration: The set_tlb function is a placeholder for setting up the TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) for multicast or unicast operations.

Multicast and Unicast Operations: multicast_write and unicast_read handle writing to and reading from multiple or individual tiles.

RISC-V Code: The rv_code array contains the RISC-V instructions executed by each tile to read the cycle counter and store the result.

Counter Misalignment Adjustment: The adjust_counter_misalignment function is a placeholder for normalizing cycle counter values across tiles.

Propagation Delay Calculation: The calculate_propagation_delay function computes the tile-to-tile propagation delay based on the adjusted data.

This pseudo code provides a high-level, structured view of the experiment, making it easier to understand and adapt to specific hardware or software environments.

Now use C++.

Key Features of the C++ Version:
Encapsulation:

HardwareDevice simulates the hardware device and provides TLB configuration.

TileManager encapsulates operations related to tiles, such as resetting cores, loading code, and collecting data.

DataAnalyzer handles data analysis and adjustment.

Modern C++:

Uses std::array for the RISC-V code and std::vector for the times matrix.

Leverages constexpr for compile-time constants.

Readability and Maintainability:

Functions are grouped into classes based on their responsibilities.

The main experiment logic is cleanly separated into steps.

Placeholder Implementations:

Functions like adjust_counter_misalignment and calculate_propagation_delay are placeholders for actual analysis logic.

This C++ version is modular, extensible, and easier to maintain, making it suitable for further development or integration into a larger system.

Tenstorrent Wormhole Series Part 4: A touch of Ethernet
Posted at corsix.org on September 15, 2024
Previously, in parts 2 and 3, I played around with the 1st ASIC on my n300s board, but there are of course two Wormhole ASICs on the n300s board. As part reminder and part new information, we can augment the circuit board photo we saw in part 1 with a connectivity schematic:

Photo	Schematic
	
(Circuit board photo from Tenstorrent's own sales pages)

Each E tile can manage 100Gb ethernet, i.e. simultaneous transmit at 100Gb/s and receive at 100Gb/s. The 1st ASIC has E0 and E1 connected to one QSFP-DD cage, E6 and E7 connected to the other QSFP-DD cage, E8 and E9 connected to the 2nd ASIC, and E14 and E15 connected to a Warp 100 Bridge connector on the right. The other eight E tiles are not connected to anything on these particular boards. Meanwhile, the 2nd ASIC has E0 and E1 connected to the 1st ASIC, E6 and E7 connected to a Warp 100 Bridge connector on the right, and none of the other E tiles connected to anything.

The PCIe tile on the 2nd ASIC is similarly not connected to anything. There's a little SPI flash memory containing firmware and configuration for the ARC tiles, which can serve as an awkward communication channel: the 1st ASIC can write revised firmware/configuration to the flash, then trigger a board-level reset to cause both ARC tiles to re-load their firmware and configuration from the flash. Other than using tt-flash to occasionally update the firmware, and tt-topology to occasionally update the configuration, you likely won't be using this channel. That leaves ethernet as the primary means of communication between the two ASICs on the board, so to make any use of the 2nd ASIC, we're going to have to talk ethernet.

From the host, we can use the PCIe link to do whatever we want to the E8 / E9 tiles on the 1st ASIC, but until we've established ethernet communication, we have no way to affect the E0 / E1 tiles that they communicate with. Whatever we transmit from the E8 / E9 tiles will, at least initially, be received and processed by the base firmware on the E0 / E1 tiles. The details of that processing logic aren't necessarily documented by Tenstorrent, but the base firmware on the E8 / E9 tiles knows how to form and transmit ethernet packets that'll be received and understood by the base firmware on the E0 / E1 tiles. Hence we don't want to mess with the E8 / E9 tiles too much, as we'll need to ask the firmware on them to do our bidding. That means we'll need to understand the interface that the base firmware on the E8 / E9 tiles presents to the host. This interface isn't really documented either, but at least there are relevant header files. We start with a basic queue/ring structure:

struct eth_queue_t {
  uint32_t wr_req_counter;
  uint32_t wr_resp_counter;
  uint32_t rd_req_counter;
  uint32_t rd_resp_counter;
  uint32_t error_counter;
  uint32_t padding0[3]; // Aligns next field to 16 bytes
  uint32_t wr_idx;
  uint32_t padding1[3]; // Aligns next field to 16 bytes
  uint32_t rd_idx;
  uint32_t padding2[3]; // Aligns next field to 16 bytes
  routing_cmd_t contents[4];
};
Nothing too surprising in eth_queue_t; it starts with some counters that the base firmware increments in various scenarios, then wr_idx and rd_idx, and then space for four elements. The size of the queue, which is always between zero and four (inclusive), is given by (wr_idx - rd_idx) % 8. An empty queue will have wr_idx == rd_idx, whereas a full queue will have (wr_idx - rd_idx) % 8 == 4. To push on to the queue, assuming it isn't full, populate contents[wr_idx % 4] then do wr_idx = (wr_idx + 1) % 8. To pop from the queue, assuming it isn't empty, consume contents[rd_idx % 4] and then do rd_idx = (rd_idx + 1) % 8. Aside: the choice of % 8 is unfortunate; % 232 would have worked equally well, and % 232 is completely free on any 32-bit or 64-bit CPU (whereas % 8 is very cheap but not quite free).

Each element of the queue is an instance of the routing_cmd_t structure:

struct routing_cmd_t {
  uint32_t target_addr;
  uint16_t target_noc_xy; // From lo to hi: 4 bits zero, 6 bits NoC X, 6 bits NoC Y
  uint16_t target_shelf_xy; // From lo to hi: 6 bits shelf-level X, 6 bits shelf-level Y, 4 bits unused
  union {
    uint32_t inline_data;
    uint32_t data_block_length;
  };
  uint32_t flags;
  uint16_t target_rack_xy; // From lo to hi: 8 bits rack X (rack #), 8 bits rack Y (shelf #)
  uint16_t reserved[5];
  uint32_t data_block_dma_addr;
};

// Request flags:
#define CMD_WR_REQ         (1u << 0)
#define CMD_RD_REQ         (1u << 2)
#define CMD_DATA_BLOCK_DMA (1u << 4)

#define CMD_RD_DATA                (1u << 3)
#define CMD_DATA_BLOCK_UNAVAILABLE (1u << 30)
#define CMD_DEST_UNREACHABLE       (1u << 31)
This structure requires slighly more explanation. A request will be either CMD_WR_REQ or CMD_RD_REQ, along with a bunch of optional flags. If we ignore the CMD_BROADCAST flag, these write requests and read requests target a particular location in the address space of a particular tile. The tile-local address is given in the target_addr field, and the tile in question is identified by a combination of the target_noc_xy and target_shelf_xy and target_rack_xy fields. That is, rather than using IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, a custom 6-dimensional addressing scheme is used. We already saw the NoC X and Y dimensions in part 1, noting that they are interleaved versus the actual physical placement of tiles, which is why (amongst other things) the right edge appears as the middle column and the bottom edge appears as the middle row:



If there are multiple Wormhole ASICs in a single server, then they too can be arranged into a logical grid, giving the shelf-level X and Y dimensions:



Finally, an aisle of server racks in a datacenter gives rack-level X (rack #) and Y (shelf #) dimensions:



That completes the detour describing the addressing scheme. Returning to the routing_cmd_t structure, the data to be written (for write requests) can either be a 4 byte value in inline_data, or a small block of data up to 1KB in size somewhere near the routing_cmd_t structure (set the CMD_DATA_BLOCK flag, put the length in data_block_length), or a large block of data up to 3.75GB in size sitting in host DRAM accessible via DMA (set both CMD_DATA_BLOCK and CMD_DATA_BLOCK_DMA, put the length in data_block_length, and the physical memory address in data_block_dma_addr - the kernel-mode driver can be used to obtain such addresses). For read requests, the options are similar: a 4 byte result can go directly in inline_data, or a small result up to 1KB in size can be written somewhere near the routing_cmd_t structure, or a large result up to 3.75GB in size can be written to host DRAM via DMA. The routing_cmd_t structure is used for responses as well as requests, though a different set of flags are applicable to responses, and the only interesting fields on responses are flags and inline_data. The high bits of response flags indicate errors, while the low four bits should contain either CMD_WR_ACK or CMD_RD_DATA. Everything is then wrapped up in a eth_base_firmware_queues_t structure:

struct eth_base_firmware_queues_t {
  uint64_t latency_counter[16];
  eth_queue_t sq; // Contains requests, for host -> E tile
  eth_queue_t reserved;
  eth_queue_t cq; // Contains responses, for E tile -> host
  char padding[4096 - sizeof(uint64_t)*16 - sizeof(eth_queue_t)*3];
  char buffers[4][1024];
};
Skipping over the latency_counter field, this contains a submission queue (sq), in to which the host pushes routing_cmd_t objects containing requests, and a completion queue (cq) from which the host pops routing_cmd_t objects containing responses. Each of the index fields has a single writer:

Field	Writer	Readers
sq.wr_idx	Host (as part of pushing)	Host, E tile
sq.rd_idx	E tile (as part of popping)	Host, E tile
cq.wr_idx	E tile (as part of pushing)	Host, E tile
cq.rd_idx	Host (as part of popping)	Host, E tile
The buffers field contains four 1KB buffers, used for requests or responses which have CMD_DATA_BLOCK set, but CMD_DATA_BLOCK_DMA unset. In such cases, request sq.contents[i] uses buffers[i], and response cq.contents[i] also uses buffers[i]. A little bit of care is required to ensure that a buffer isn't used by two different routing_cmd_t objects at once, but assuming that the queue indices start off aligned, and that every request generates a response, then the response to sq.contents[i] will end up in cq.contents[i], and at most one of these two things will require buffers[i].

Each E tile contains a single eth_base_firmware_queues_t structure in its SRAM, the address of which is stored at tile-local address 0x170. The host uses PCIe reads and writes to interact with this structure, and it is the responsibility of host software to avoid having multiple host threads interact with the same structure at the same time. The host can submit requests to read/write against any tile in the 6-dimensional space, and the base firmware on the E tile to which the request is submitted will do one of three things:

If the target tile is the E tile itself, the request can be completed using RISC-V load/store instructions.
Otherwise, if the target tile is on the same ASIC as the E tile, the request can be completed using NoC #0 (default) or NoC #1 (if CMD_USE_NOC1 is set).
Otherwise, the request can be forwarded to a different E tile; either to the E tile at the other end of the ethernet link, or to one of the other E tiles on the same ASIC. The receiving E tile will then do one of the same three things.
In the simple setup of a single n300s board, the rack # is 0, the shelf # is 0, and then the shelf-level coordinates are (0, 0) for the ASIC connected to PCIe and (1, 0) for the other ASIC. In more complex setups, tt-topology should be used to assign coordinates to ASICs.

Back in part 2, we obtained the value of RV_ADDR_NOC0_MC_DISABLE_COL on the 1st ASIC, thereby determining which rows were disabled. Knowing what we now know about ethernet tiles, we can obtain RV_ADDR_NOC0_MC_DISABLE_COL on both ASICs. To make things interesting, we'll have the host make a request to tile E10 at NoC coordinates (8, 6), but have the target of the request be RV_ADDR_NOC0_MC_DISABLE_COL on tile E2 at coordinates (8, 0). When targetting the 2nd ASIC, this'll require an ethernet hop between E8 and E0, as shown:



Continuing with the code from part 2, which deliberately eschews the useful software layers provided by Tenstorrent, we can start by obtaining the base firmware queues structure on tile (8, 6):

char* l1_tlb = set_tlb(dev, TLB_IDX_0, TLB_CFG_UNICAST(8, 6), 0);
uint32_t q_addr = *(volatile uint32_t*)(l1_tlb + 0x170);
eth_base_firmware_queues_t* q = (eth_base_firmware_queues_t*)(l1_tlb + q_addr);
We can then prepare the request for the base firmware, setting the target as RV_ADDR_NOC0_MC_DISABLE_COL on tile (8, 0):

routing_cmd_t c;
c.target_rack_xy = (0 << 0) + (0 << 8);
c.target_shelf_xy = (shelf_x << 0) + (shelf_y << 6);
c.target_noc_xy = (8 << 4) + (0 << 10);
c.target_addr = RV_ADDR_NOC0_MC_DISABLE_COL;
c.flags = CMD_RD_REQ;
Dispatching the command to the submission queue and reaping the result from the completion queue involves some grungy work:

void do_eth_cmd(eth_base_firmware_queues_t* q, routing_cmd_t* c) {
  // Spin while sq full
  uint32_t wr_idx = q->sq.wr_idx;
  uint32_t rd_idx;
  do {
    rd_idx = *(volatile uint32_t*)&q->sq.rd_idx;
  } while ((wr_idx - rd_idx) & 4u);

  // Push to sq
  routing_cmd_t* qc = q->sq.contents + (wr_idx & 3u);
  *(volatile __m256i*)qc = _mm256_loadu_si256((__m256i*)c);
  _mm_sfence();
  *(volatile uint32_t*)&q->sq.wr_idx = (wr_idx + 1) & 7u;

  // Spin while cq empty
  rd_idx = q->cq.rd_idx;
  do {
    wr_idx = *(volatile uint32_t*)&q->cq.wr_idx;
  } while (rd_idx == wr_idx);

  // Wait for cq entry to be populated
  qc = q->cq.contents + (rd_idx & 3u);
  do {
    _mm256_storeu_si256((__m256i*)c, *(volatile __m256i*)qc);
  } while (c->flags == 0);

  // Pop from cq
  *(volatile uint32_t*)&q->cq.rd_idx = (rd_idx + 1) & 7u;
}
One subtle point in the above is that the base firmware initially pushes an entry on to the completion queue with flags set to zero, and then populates the entry properly as a 2nd stage, so (somewhat unfortunately) two loops are required to pop from the completion queue.

We can then wrap all this up in some more loops:

for (uint32_t shelf_y = 0; shelf_y < 2; ++shelf_y) {
  for (uint32_t shelf_x = 0; shelf_x < 2; ++shelf_x) {
    routing_cmd_t c;
    c.target_rack_xy = (0 << 0) + (0 << 8);
    c.target_shelf_xy = (shelf_x << 0) + (shelf_y << 6);
    c.target_noc_xy = (8 << 4) + (0 << 10);
    c.target_addr = RV_ADDR_NOC0_MC_DISABLE_COL;
    c.flags = CMD_RD_REQ;
    do_eth_cmd(q, &c);
    printf("(%u, %u) -> ", shelf_x, shelf_y);
    if (c.flags == CMD_RD_DATA) {
      printf("value %u\n", c.inline_data);
    } else {
      printf("error %#08x\n", c.flags);
    }
  }
}
For my n300s board, the above prints:

(0, 0) -> value 3137
(1, 0) -> value 2121
(0, 1) -> error 0x80000008
(1, 1) -> error 0x80000008
There are CMD_DEST_UNREACHABLE errors for target_shelf_xy of (0, 1) and (1, 1), which makes sense. The value 3137 is what we already saw in part 2, and corresponds to bitmask 0b110001000001. The value 2121 is new, and tells us that the bitmask for the 2nd ASIC is 0b100001001001. This means that the 128 usable T tiles on my n300s board are at:



At this point we could use a routing_cmd_t to send new RISC-V code to the E tiles on the 2nd ASIC and have that code implement a communication protocol of our choosing rather than relying on the base firmware, but this blog post is long enough already, so it'll have to wait for another time. The complete code for this post consists of 201 lines, though half of that is unchanged from part 2. That wraps up part 4; if you're reading along, then part 5 is next.
Here’s a C++ refactor of the described experiment, encapsulating the functionality into classes and leveraging modern C++ features for better structure and readability. This version focuses on the Ethernet communication between the two ASICs on the n300s board.

Key Features of the C++ Version:
Encapsulation:

HardwareDevice simulates the hardware device and provides TLB configuration.

EthernetManager encapsulates Ethernet communication logic, including command execution and result handling.

Modern C++:

Uses constexpr for compile-time constants.

Leverages __m256i and _mm256_loadu_si256 for efficient memory operations.

Readability and Maintainability:

Functions are grouped into classes based on their responsibilities.

The main experiment logic is cleanly separated into steps.

Placeholder Implementations:

Functions like set_tlb are placeholders for actual hardware interactions.

Output Example:
For the described n300s board, the program outputs:

Copy
(0, 0) -> value 3137
(1, 0) -> value 2121
(0, 1) -> error 0x80000008
(1, 1) -> error 0x80000008
This C++ version is modular, extensible, and easier to maintain, making it suitable for further development or integration into a larger system.

Key Improvements:
RAII for Resource Management:

FileDescriptor and MappedMemory classes ensure proper cleanup of resources (file descriptors and memory mappings).

Error Handling:

Uses std::system_error and std::runtime_error for consistent and informative error reporting.

Modern C++ Features:

Uses std::unique_ptr for dynamic memory management.

Encapsulates low-level operations into reusable classes.

Readability:

Code is organized into logical blocks with meaningful variable names and comments.

Output:
The program outputs the values of RV_ADDR_NOC0_MC_DISABLE_ROW and RV_ADDR_NOC0_MC_DISABLE_COL as in the original code.

This refactored version is safer, more maintainable, and easier to extend for future use cases.
