- Mediated by prolactin inhibition of dopamine

**Females**:
- Highly variable
- Many have no refractory period (multiorgasmic capacity)
- When present, typically shorter (5-15 min)
- Less prolactin elevation hypothesis

#### Psychological State
- **Satisfaction**: Contentment, fulfillment
- **Relaxation**: Reduced anxiety
- **Bonding**: Enhanced closeness with partner

## Individual & Contextual Variation

### Factors Affecting Timing

**Biological**:
- Age (older = longer refractory, sometimes longer plateau)
- Hormonal status (menstrual cycle, medications)
- Neurological health
- Vascular health

**Psychological**:
- Arousal level / desire
- Stress and anxiety (can prolong or prevent orgasm)
- Depression (often delayed orgasm)
- Relationship satisfaction

**Behavioral**:
- Type of stimulation
- Experience and learning
- Deliberate control techniques (edging)
- Substance use (alcohol, drugs)

**Sex/Gender**:
- Females often slower excitement, longer plateau
- Males often faster excitement, shorter refractory
- Substantial overlap and individual variation

### Clinical Variations

**Premature Ejaculation**:
- Shortened excitement/plateau (< 1 minute)
- Immediate transition to orgasm
- Treatment: SSRIs (increase serotonin, delay), behavioral techniques

**Delayed Ejaculation**:
- Extended plateau (> 30 minutes)
- Difficulty or inability to reach orgasm
- Causes: SSRIs, anxiety, aging

**Anorgasmia**:
- Cannot reach orgasm phase
- Plateau maintained but no climax
- More common in females, often psychological

## Research Methods for Studying Phases

### Subjective Measurement
- **Self-report scales**: Continuous arousal ratings during stimulation
- **Event marking**: Participants indicate phase transitions

### Physiological Measurement
- **Genital plethysmography**: Objective measure of engorgement
- **Cardiovascular monitoring**: HR, BP, HRV
- **Myography**: Muscle tension measurement
- **Thermography**: Skin temperature changes

### Neuroimaging
- **fMRI**: Brain activation patterns per phase (limited temporal resolution)
- **PET**: Neurotransmitter activity (limited temporal resolution)
- **EEG**: High temporal resolution, can track phase transitions

### Endocrine Sampling
- **Blood draws**: Pre/post arousal comparisons
- **Serial sampling**: Multiple timepoints during resolution
- **Saliva samples**: Less invasive, good for repeated measures

## Evolutionary Perspective

The temporal structure of sexual arousal serves adaptive functions:

- **Desire phase**: Selectivity, ensures appropriate partners/contexts
- **Excitement phase**: Prepares body for intercourse
- **Plateau phase**: Maintains arousal for adequate stimulation/fertilization
- **Orgasm phase**:
  - Males: Ejaculation for reproduction
  - Females: May enhance sperm retention (controversial)
  - Both: Bonding and reinforcement
- **Resolution/Refractory**: Prevents excessive time in vulnerable state

## Practical Implications
