- D2 receptor activation critical
- Released in anticipation and during copulation

**Serotonin Effects**:
- Inhibits ejaculation (prolongs latency)
- 5-HT1A agonists facilitate, 5-HT2C agonists inhibit
- SSRIs delay ejaculation via serotonin increase

**Integration**:
- Dopamine/serotonin balance regulates arousal and ejaculation
- Individual variation in baseline levels

**Clinical Applications**:
- Dopamine agonists for low desire

## Hormonal Mechanisms

### Bancroft (2005)
**"The endocrinology of sexual arousal"**
*Journal of Endocrinology*, 186(3), 411-427
DOI: 10.1677/joe.1.06233

**Significance**: Comprehensive review of hormonal influences on arousal.

**Testosterone**:
- Drives desire in all sexes
- Affects arousal threshold
- Declines with age (more pronounced in males)
- Replacement therapy effective for hypogonadism

**Estrogen** (females):
- Enhances genital sensitivity
- Varies across menstrual cycle
- Postmenopausal decline affects arousal
- Not strongly related to desire (unlike testosterone)

**Progesterone**:
- Generally inhibitory
- High in luteal phase may reduce desire

**Cortisol**:
- Chronic stress inhibits arousal
- Suppresses HPG axis
- Acutely, may enhance (arousal interpretation)

**Integration**: Hormones set arousal "tone" but don't directly cause arousal

---

### Krüger et al. (2002)
**"Specificity of the neuroendocrine response to orgasm during sexual arousal in men"**
*Journal of Endocrinology*, 177(1), 57-64
DOI: 10.1677/joe.0.1770057

**Significance**: Documented hormonal changes during arousal and after orgasm.

**Key Findings**:
- **Prolactin**: Surges after orgasm (3-4x baseline)
- **Cortisol**: Slight increase during arousal
- **Testosterone**: No acute change
- **Oxytocin**: Increases during arousal, peaks at orgasm

**Prolactin Finding**:
- Magnitude correlates with subjective orgasm quality
- Remains elevated 30-120 minutes
- Likely mediates refractory period

**Methodology**: Blood samples before, during, and after sexual activity

**Clinical**: Hyperprolactinemia as cause of low libido

## Theoretical Frameworks

### Janssen & Bancroft (2007)
**"The dual control model: The role of sexual inhibition and excitation in sexual arousal and behavior"**
In *The Psychophysiology of Sex*

**Significance**: Influential model explaining individual differences in arousal.

**Core Concept**:
- Sexual response = balance of excitation and inhibition
- **SES (Sexual Excitation System)**: Promotes arousal
- **SIS (Sexual Inhibition System)**: Inhibits arousal
- People vary in SES/SIS sensitivity

**Individual Differences**:
- High SES + Low SIS = Easily aroused, risk for problematic sexuality
- Low SES + High SIS = Difficulty arousing, risk for arousal disorders
- Most people in middle range

**Clinical Applications**:
- Assessment: SIS/SES questionnaires
- Treatment: Target excitation or inhibition
- Personalized approaches based on profile

**Research Impact**: >1000 citations, widely used framework

DOI: 10.1080/00224490902747768

**Significance**: Comprehensive integration of biological and psychological factors.

**Incentive Motivation Model**:
- Sexual stimuli acquire "incentive salience" through learning
- Dopamine mediates incentive motivation
- Context and experience shape arousal
- Feedback from arousal amplifies motivation

**Integration of Levels**:
- Hormonal: Set baseline sensitivity
- Neural: Process stimuli and generate arousal
- Cognitive: Appraisal and attention
- Behavioral: Approach and consummation

**Novel Aspect**: Emphasizes learning and plasticity, not just innate responses

**Prediction**: Sexual preferences and arousal patterns shaped by experience

DOI: 10.1037/0022-006X.54.2.140

**Significance**: Explained how anxiety affects sexual function differently in functional vs. dysfunctional individuals.

**Key Model**:
- **Functional individuals**: Anxiety → sympathetic arousal → enhanced genital response
- **Dysfunctional individuals**: Anxiety → distraction/cognitive interference → impaired arousal

**Cognitive Factors**:
- Attention to erotic vs. threat cues
- Performance monitoring ("spectatoring")
- Negative expectancies

**Clinical Implications**:
- Cognitive-behavioral therapy targets
- Mindfulness to improve attention
- Reduce performance pressure

**"The female sexual response: a different model"**
*Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy*, 26(1), 51-65
DOI: 10.1080/009262300278641

**Significance**: Proposed alternative to linear models for female sexuality.

**Basson's Circular Model**:
- Sexual response can begin from non-desire state
- Responsive desire (triggered by stimulation)
- Intimacy and emotional satisfaction central
- Arousal → desire → more arousal (circular)

**Contrast to Linear Model**:
- Linear: Desire → Arousal → Orgasm
- Circular: Multiple entry points, intimacy goals

**Clinical Impact**:
- Normalized responsive desire
- Emphasized relationship context
- Guided therapy for women with "low desire"
