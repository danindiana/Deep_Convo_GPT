Explain how Warhammer 40k ork tech works.



Ork technology is a fascinating blend of ramshackle engineering, surprisingly advanced weaponry, and a healthy dose of psychic power. Here's a breakdown of the key elements:   

1. The WAAAAGH! and the Power of Belief:

Orks possess a collective psychic field known as the WAAAAGH! This field is generated by their emotions, particularly their bloodlust and desire for battle. The stronger the WAAAAGH!, the more powerful and effective their technology becomes.   
A core principle is that if enough Orks believe something will work, it will work, regardless of how illogical or improbable it seems. This is why red paint makes their vehicles go faster, and why guns cobbled together from scrap metal can fire devastating projectiles.
2. Innate Mechanical Knowledge:

Orks have an instinctive understanding of mechanics and engineering, likely a remnant of their ancient origins as a genetically engineered warrior race. This allows even the most unskilled Ork to make basic repairs and modifications to their equipment.
This innate knowledge is further enhanced by the WAAAAGH! field, enabling Mekboyz (Ork mechanics) to subconsciously tap into the collective knowledge of their species and create surprisingly advanced weaponry.
3. Scrap and Salvage:

Orks are masters of recycling and repurposing. They scavenge battlefields and abandoned settlements for any scrap metal they can find, using it to build their vehicles, weapons, and fortifications.   
This "make-do-and-mend" approach results in a distinctive ramshackle aesthetic, with Ork technology often looking crude and cobbled together. However, beneath the rough exterior lies a surprising level of functionality.   
4. Examples of Ork Technology:

Shootas: These crude firearms are often little more than pipes and scrap metal, yet they fire deadly projectiles thanks to the Orks' belief in their effectiveness.   
Trukks: These ramshackle vehicles are built from salvaged parts and held together by sheer Ork willpower. They are surprisingly fast and durable, capable of transporting Orks into the heart of battle.   
Gargantz: These massive walkers are the pinnacle of Ork engineering, towering over the battlefield and armed with devastating weaponry. They are a testament to the Orks' ability to create powerful machines despite their crude methods.
In summary: Ork technology is a unique blend of psychic power, innate mechanical knowledge, and salvaged materials. It is a testament to the Orks' resilience, ingenuity, and unwavering belief in their own abilities.

Ok. So. Man, you know the "emperor of mankind" in wh40k? Like he requires 10K psyker sacrifices or something per day just to stay alive? Like that's a big milkshake you have to go come up with. Just saying do you think he is really "alive" alive or did he die along time ago?



The exact status of the Emperor of Mankind in the Warhammer 40k universe is a subject of much debate and speculation among fans and loremasters alike. While the official stance is that he is still alive, albeit in a severely weakened state, there is evidence to suggest that he may have died long ago.

Arguments for the Emperor's continued existence:

The Astronomican: The Astronomican, a beacon of light that guides humanity through the warp, is powered by the Emperor's psychic energy. As long as the Astronomican burns, it is believed that the Emperor is still alive.
Occasional manifestations: The Emperor has been known to make sporadic appearances or communicate with individuals through dreams or visions. These appearances suggest that he is still conscious and aware of the events unfolding in the Imperium.
His role as a symbol: The Emperor serves as a symbol of hope and unity for humanity. His continued existence gives them something to believe in and fight for.
Arguments for the Emperor's death:

The Golden Throne: The Emperor is interred on the Golden Throne, a device that sustains his life but also slowly kills him. The constant drain on his life force suggests that he is not truly alive in the traditional sense.
The lack of direct communication: While the Emperor has been known to communicate with individuals, these interactions are rare and often cryptic. This lack of direct communication suggests that he is no longer in full control of his faculties.
The corruption of the warp: The warp, the psychic realm of the Imperium, is a dangerous and unpredictable place. It is possible that the Emperor's prolonged exposure to the warp has corrupted his mind and body, rendering him effectively dead.
Ultimately, the true nature of the Emperor's existence remains a mystery. The official lore is intentionally vague on this point, leaving room for interpretation and debate. Whether he is alive or dead, the Emperor remains a powerful symbol of hope and defiance in the dark and unforgiving universe of Warhammer 40k.






Can you generate a canticle for imperial guardsmen against the corrupting influence of Slaanesh?



A Canticle Against the Prince of Pleasure

A grim litany for the Imperial Guardsman, to be recited before battle or during moments of doubt.

Let not the siren’s song beguile your ear,
Nor pleasure’s promise tempt your soul to fear.
For in the darkness, a darker power lurks,
A Prince of Pleasure, a master of works.

He whispers sweet nothings, a venomous lie,
A false dawn painting hope across the sky.
But know, true joy is found in duty’s call,
In selfless service, answering the Emperor’s thrall.

Steel your heart, strengthen your mind,
Let discipline and purpose intertwine.
Resist the whispers, the visions, the dreams,
For they are but illusions, a devil’s dark schemes.

In the Emperor’s name, we march as one,
Against the Chaos, ‘til the final sun.
Let righteous fury burn within your core,
And purge the galaxy of evil evermore.






Compose a similar one for protection against the Chaos God Tzeentch.



A Canticle Against the Architect of Fate

A litany of grounding and focus for the faithful servant of the Emperor, to be spoken in the face of Tzeentch's trickery.

Beware the shifting tides of change,
The whispers that twist and rearrange.
The Architect of Fate, with eyes ablaze,
Weaves webs of deceit in a bewildering maze.

He offers knowledge, a tempting prize,
But hidden within are treacherous lies.
His truths are fleeting, his promises vain,
Leading to madness, to sorrow and pain.

Hold fast to your faith, your purpose clear,
Let loyalty and duty quell all fear.
Doubt is a weapon, wielded with skill,
By the Changer of Ways, to bend you to his will.

Trust not your senses, nor the thoughts they breed,
For Tzeentch sows discord, planting seeds of greed.
Find strength in the Emperor's unwavering light,
A beacon of truth in the darkest night.

Stand firm against the swirling chaos,
Reject the whispers, the tempting morass.
With unwavering resolve, and hearts ablaze,
We shall prevail against the Changer of Ways.

The Chaos Gods are in truth not really divine beings, though their great power often means there is little difference for those mortals who revere them. These Warp entities are created and sustained by the emotions and collective desires of every sentient being of the material universe. When an emotion or belief in realspace grows strong or widespread enough across the galaxy, it becomes embodied as one of the sentient denizens of the Warp.

The most powerful and most malevolent of these have become the Gods of Chaos. Although they are god-like beings, the Dark Gods are by their nature monomaniacal and completely single-minded since they are formed entirely of a single emotion or concept.

The Chaos Gods are dependent upon the emotions of mortal creatures, especially the hordes of Humanity, for their power and continued existence. As a result, the Chaos Gods strive to convert all mortals to their worship and service so that they may ultimately dominate the universe. However, if they were to win such a dark victory, it would likely destroy all of reality when the dimensional separation between realspace and the Immaterium broke down in its wake.

The Chaos Gods and the forces of Chaos that serve them are the greatest enemies of the Imperium of Man, the Aeldari and most other sentient forms of life in the Milky Way Galaxy, even if they are not fully aware yet of the threat Chaos poses, like the T'au Empire.

The Chaos Gods are able to devote a fraction of their psychic power in the Warp to create Daemons, psychic entities whose appearance and character reflect their patron god's own nature.

These Daemons may be reabsorbed into the god at their whim. The least of the minor Chaos Gods may be so limited in their power that expending that power to create a Daemon means their entire power is expended; in effect, the god becomes a Daemon.

In the Warp, the psychic reflection of similar thoughts and emotions gather together like rivulets of water running down a cliff face. They form streams and eddies of anguish and desire, pools of hatred and torrents of pride.

Since the dawn of time, these tides and waves of psychic energy have flowed unceasingly through the mirror realm of the Warp, and such is their power that they forged creatures made of the very stuff of dreams and nightmares.



A map of the Realm of Chaos; note the positions and distances between the places on this map are only allegorical; distance and time have no meanings in the Immaterium.

Eventually, these instinctual, formless entities gained a rudimentary consciousness of their own. The Chaos Gods were born -- vast psychic presences composed of the fantasies and horrors of mortals. These are the Ruinous Powers, and each one is a reflection of the mortal passions that formed them.

First amongst them is Khorne, the Lord of Battle, possessed of towering and immortal fury. Tzeentch, the bizarre and ever-changing Architect of Fate, weaves powerful sorceries to bind the future to his will, whilst great Nurgle, the Lord of Decay, labours endlessly to spread infection and pestilence. The last of their number is Slaanesh, the Dark Prince of Chaos, indulgent of every pleasure and excess, no matter how immoral or perverse.

As the intelligent species of the Milky Way Galaxy prospered and grew, so too did their hopes and ambitions, their anger and wars, their love and hatred. This burgeoning flood of raw emotion fed the Chaos Gods and nurtured their power.

Before long, the gods reached back to their makers with a curious and hungry sentience, planting seeds of corruption in the souls of those whose dreams they passed through. So were the first mortals bound to the will of the Ruinous Powers, and seeing the fruits of their labours, the gods began their eternal work to influence the physical realm and its myriad sentient races.

Lured by promises of extraordinary power and immortality, some mortals serve the Chaos Gods willingly, fomenting misery, war and death amongst their people in order to sustain and elevate their dark masters. Yet the Chaos Gods are fickle, prone to reneging or altering a deal on a whim, and few of these worshippers are ever granted the rewards they seek.

A Chaos God can only grow in power through the actions and thoughts of mortals. Those who worship a Chaos God, and behave in a way that feeds it, are rewarded with strange "gifts," extraordinary powers and potentially, immortality as a Daemon Prince. As the Chaos Gods battle in the Warp, so their mortal followers wage war in the material universe.

The victors of the battles earn more power for their unworldy master, though the twisted plans of the Chaos Gods are such that often victory is not necessary; merely the acts of sacrifice and battle themselves.

When devotees of Chaos die, their souls do not fade in the Warp and disappear like the spirits of others to some unknown and unknowable fate. Instead, their immortal energy is swallowed into the greatness of their gods, their souls sustained forever, bound to the eternal power of Chaos.

As a Chaos God gathers such energy, it expands in power, and its influence and territory within the Warp's Realm of Chaos grows. As extensions of the gods, the appearances of these domains are formed upon the same emotions that created their masters: Khorne's realm is founded on anger and bloodletting; Tzeentch's lands are scintillating constructs of pure magic; Nurgle's territory is a haven of death and regeneration, and Slaanesh's dominion is a paradise of damning temptations.

Though realm and god are as one, the Chaos Gods each have a form that embodies their personalities and dwells at the very heart of their territories. Wreathed in unearthly power, the Chaos Gods watch over their realms, seeking any disturbances in the pattern of the Warp that signal intrusion or opportunity

C'tan



VIEW SOURCE



"They came to us as gods and we, like fools, took them at their word. Mephet'ran the Deceiver, Aza'gorod the Nightbringer, Iash'uddra the Endless Swarm; I curse their names, and the names of all their malevolent brethren."

— From the Chronicle of Szarekh, Last of the Silent Kings



The necrodermis-sheathed C'tan Shard of Aza'gorod the Nightbringer in combat against the foes of the Necrons.

The C'tan (pronounced ker-TAN) or Star Gods, called Yngir in the Aeldari Lexicon, are said to be the oldest intelligent beings in existence in the Milky Way Galaxy. It is said that they were created at the very beginning of the universe, incorporeal entities spawned from swirling gases and enormous amounts of energy, and as such are etheric creatures by nature.

In their natural form they are vast beings of pure energy who spread themselves over the surface of a star, absorbing its solar energy to feed themselves. After a time, they learned to use diaphanous wings created from the universe's lines of electromagnetic force to travel to other stars to continue their consumption when their host star died. The matter of planets and nebulae around them was so insignificant that it did not register on their voracious appetite.

They are able to interact with the physical world thanks to the technology of the Necrontyr which transferred their consciousnesses into robotic bodies that resembled those of the Necrontyr culture's ancient deities that were made of the living metal called necrodermis. The C'tan used the hatred of the Necrontyr towards the ancient species called the Old Ones to help them gather the more appetizing energy emitted by living beings that they came to crave.



The C'tan Shard of Mephet'ran the Deceiver.

The C'tan hate the Warp and its psychic energies (even as they crave the living energies of organic beings) and had the Necrons construct a series of blackstone pylons on the world of Cadia and other planets across several sectors in the Segmentum Obscurus. When completed, these constructs were intended to close off the Warp from the material universe entirely, utterly destroying any living creatures with a soul, leaving all other life in the galaxy as nourishment for the C'tan.

It was the C'tan who designed the process of biotransference for the Necrontyr, transferring their proteges' consciousnesses wholesale into undying mechanical bodies similar to their own that were also composed of necrodermis. However, the biotransference process also transformed the Necrontyr into the Necrons, soulless beings who have difficulty taking pleasure in anything and who can never truly enjoy their immortality.

After the end of the War in Heaven against their ancient foes the Old Ones, the Necrons, led by the Silent King Szarekh, successfully rebelled against their C'tan Star Gods. Those C'tan who survived the revolt were broken into fragments known as C'tan Shards that were more easily contained and imprisoned within arcane Necron devices called Tesseract Labyrinths.

At present, since the majority of the Necrons began to awaken from the Great Sleep in the 41st Millennium, these C'tan Shards are deployed when needed as the Necron Dynasties' greatest weapons on the battlefield.

However, there always exists the possibility that the imprisoned C'tan will escape their captors. Then they will wreak a terrible vengeance upon their captors and the innocent alike...

History

Star Gods

The birth of the entities known as the Star Gods occurred at the same time as the moment of Creation itself, as they formed from the vast, insensate energies first unleashed by that churning mass of cataclysmic force. In that anarchic interweaving of matter and energy, the sea of stars began to swirl into existence and for an eon the universe was nothing more than hot hydrogen gas and light elemental dust ruled over by the gravitic force of billions of newborn suns.

Long before the first planets had formed and cooled, the very first truly self-aware beings emerged, their thoughts encased within the lines of force produced by the plasma and electromagnetic flares of the stars themselves. In later times, these entities would become known as the C'tan, but early in their existence they were nothing like the malevolent beings they would eventually become.

They were little more than monstrous energy parasites that suckled upon the solar energies of the stars that had brought them into existence, shortening the lives of otherwise main-sequence stars by millions of standard years. In time, these star vampires learned to move on the diaphanous wings of the universe's electromagnetic flux, leaving their birthplaces to drift through the cosmic ether to new stellar feeding grounds and begin their cycle of stellar destruction once more.

Beings of pure energy, they paid no mind to the hunks of solid matter they passed in the vacuum of space, the blazing geothermal fires and weak geomagnetic fields of these nascent planets insufficient to be worth feeding even their ravenous hunger.

The Necrontyr and the Wars of Secession

The humanoid species that would become the Necrons began their existence under a fearsome, scourging star in the far reaches of the galaxy known as the Halo Stars region, billions of standard years before Humanity evolved on Terra. Assailed at every moment by ionising solar winds and intense radiation storms, the flesh and blood Necrontyr became a morbid people whose precarious life spans were riven by constant loss.

What little information the Imperium of Man has recovered on the Necrontyr tells that their lives were short and uncertain, their bodies blighted and consumed at an early age by the terrible cancers and other illnesses linked to the high levels of ionising radiation given off by their sun. Necrontyr cities were built in anticipation of their inhabitants' early demise, as the living were only brief residents enduring in the shadow of the vast sepulchres and tombs of their ancestors.

Likewise, the Necrontyr's ruling dynasties were founded on the anticipation of demise, and the living were thought of as no more than temporary residents hurrying through the more permanent and lasting structures raised to honour the dead.

On the Necrontyr homeworld, the greatest monuments were always built for the dead, never the living. Driven by necessity, the Necrontyr escaped their crucible-prison and struck out for the stars, hopeful of carving out an empire in which they could realise their species' potential free from the lethal energies of their birth star.

Unable to find peace on their own world, the Necrontyr blindly groped outward into the universe to explore other stars. Using stasis crypts and slow-moving, antimatter-powered torch-ships that were clad in the living metal known as necrodermis to resist the millennia-long journeys through the void, the Necrontyr began to colonise distant worlds.

Little by little, the Necrontyr dynasties spread ever further, until much of the ancient galaxy answered to their rule. From the earliest days, the rulers of individual Necrontyr dynasties were themselves governed by the Triarch, a council composed of three Necrontyr monarchs or "phaerons." The head of the Triarch was known as the "Silent King," for he addressed his subjects only through the other two phaerons who ruled alongside him.

Nominally a hereditary position, the uncertain life spans of the Necrontyr ensured that the title of Silent King nonetheless passed from one royal dynasty to another many times. The final days of the Necrontyr Empire occurred in the reign of Szarekh, the last of the Silent Kings.

Sometime during their slow expansion, the Necrontyr encountered an ancient, intelligent species far older than any other in existence in the known galaxy. Collectively, these beings were known as the "Old Ones," and they were absolute masters of forms of energy the Necrontyr could not even conceive of, yet alone wield.

The Old Ones had long ago conquered the secrets of immortality, yet they refused to share the gift of eternal life with the Necrontyr, who yet bore the genetic curse of the bitter star they had been born under. The colonisation of much of the galaxy by the reptilian mystics of the Old Ones had been immeasurably swifter and more expansive than that of the Necrontyr because of their Warp Gates and mastery of the psychic power of the Immaterium.

That, and the Old Ones' incredibly long, if not downright immortal lifespans, kindled a burning, jealous rage in the Necrontyr, which ate at their culture spiritually as much as their physical cancers consumed their bodies. The Necrontyr were astonished to learn that another advanced, intelligent species enjoyed such long lives while their own were cut so brutally short.

But as time wore on, further strife came to the Necrontyr. Each dynasty of the Necrontyr sought to claim its own destiny and soon the great houses were engaged in all-out conflicts known as the Wars of Secession. Had circumstances remained as they were for but a generation more, it is possible that the Necrontyr would have wiped themselves out, as so many species had before them and shall do in the future.

As their interstellar territory grew ever wider and more diverse, the unity that had made them strong was eroded, and bitter wars were waged as entire Necrontyr realms fought to win independence. Ultimately, the Triach -- the ruling council of the Necrontyr Empire -- realised that the only hope of unity lay in conflict with an external enemy, but there were few who could prove a credible threat.

Only the Old Ones, the first of all the galaxy's known sentient species, were a prospective foe powerful enough to bind the feuding Necrontyr dynasties to a common cause. Such a war was simplicity itself to justify, for the Necrontyr had ever rankled at the Old Ones' refusal to share the secrets of eternal life.

So did the Triarch declare war on the Old Ones. At the same time, they offered amnesty to any secessionist dynasties who willingly returned to the fold. Thus lured by the spoils of victory and the promise of immortality, the separatist Necrontyr realms abandoned their Wars of Secession and the War in Heaven began.

It was the last of the Silent Kings who headed the Triarch of the Necrontyr Empire, Szarekh, who formulated the plan that would change everything forever and have consequences that would echo through history for countless millions of Terran years. In a typically bitter act of jealousy and resentment for the Necrontyr race, it was the Silent King who used the Old Ones' refusal to share the secret of immortality as a pretext for war, forcibly uniting the entire Necrontyr species beneath the rule of the Triarch against their common foe.

War erupted across the stars, yet while the Silent King succeeded in uniting his hateful people, it was a war the Necrontyr could not win. Not on their own.

War in Heaven



The mechanical horror of the Necrons.

The terrible wars between the Old Ones and the Necrontyr that followed, known later in Aeldari myth as the "War in Heaven," would fill a library in their own right, but the Necrontyr could never win. Their superior technology was consistently outmanoeuvred by the Old Ones thanks to their mastery of the Webway portals and Warp Gates.

The Necrontyr were pushed back until they were little more than an irritation to the Old Ones' dominance of the galaxy, a quiescent threat clinging to their irradiated world among the Halo Stars, exiled and forgotten. The Necrontyr's fury was cooled by their long millennia of imprisonment on their homeworld, slowly transforming into an utter hatred towards all other forms of intelligent life and an implacable determination to avenge themselves upon their seemingly invincible enemies.

But in the face of defeat, the always fragile unity of the Necrontyr began to fracture once more. No longer did the prospect of a common enemy have any hold over the disparate dynasties. Scores of generations had now lived and died in the service of an unwinnable war, and many Necrontyr dynasties would have gladly sued for peace with the Old Ones if the ruling Triarch had permitted it.

Thus began the second iteration of the Wars of Secession, more widespread and ruinous than any that had come before. So fractured had the Necrontyr dynasties become by then that, had the Old Ones been so inclined, they could have wiped out their foes with ease. Faced with the total collapse of their rule, the Triarch searched desperately for a means of restoring order. In this, their prayers were answered, though the price for their species would be incalculably high.

It was during the reign of the Silent King Szarekh that the godlike energy beings known as the C'tan first blighted the Necrontyr. It is impossible to say for certain how the Necrontyr first made contact with the C'tan, though many misleading, contradictory and one-sided accounts of these events exist.

The dusty archives of Solemnace claim it was but an accident, a chance discovery made by a stellar probe during the investigation of a dying star. The Book of Mournful Night, held under close guard in the Black Library's innermost sanctum, tells rather that the raw hatred that the Necrontyr held as a race for the Old Ones sang out across space, acting as a beacon that the C'tan could not ignore.

Another account claims that from the earliest days of their civilisation, Necrontyr scientists had been deeply engaged in stellar studies to try to understand and protect themselves from their own sun's baleful energies. After long, bitter Terran centuries of searching for some power to unleash upon the Old Ones, the Necrontyr researchers used stellar probes to discover unusual electrodynamic anomalies in the oldest, dying stars of the galaxy.

In the complex skeins of the energetic plasma of these suns, the Necrontyr found a sentience that was more ancient than that of any of the corporeal species in Creation, including the Old Ones, entities of pure energy that had spawned during the birth of the stars eons before. These entities had little conception of what the rest of the universe entailed when the Necrontyr first found them, feeding upon the solar flares and magnetic storms of these bloated red giants.

Here was the weapon the Necrontyr had long sought to bring about the downfall of the Old Ones, beings of pure energy that they believed were the progeny of the death-god they worshipped. Howsoever first contact occurred, the shadow of the C'tan fell over the oldest Necrontyr dynasties first.

The power of these star-born creatures was incredible, the raw energy of the stars made animate, and the Necrontyr called them the C'tan or "Star Gods" in their own tongue. The C'tan were dispersed across areas larger than whole planets, their consciousnesses too vast for humanoids to comprehend. How the Necrontyr ever managed to communicate with them is unknown to the Adeptus Mechanicus.

Understanding that such diffuse minds could never perceive the material universe without manifesting themselves in a material form, some Necrontyr actively sought the C'tan's favour and oversaw the forging of physical shells for the C'tan to occupy, cast from the living metal called necrodermis that they had once used for their colony torch-ships.

Fragmentary Aeldari legends tell of translucent streamers of electromagnetic force shifting across space as the star vampires coiled into their new bodies in the physical realm across an incorporeal bridge of starlight. Thus clad, the C'tan took the shapes of the Necrontyr's half-forgotten gods, hiding their own desires beneath cloaks of obsequious subservience.

Incomprehensible forces were compressed into the living metal of the necrodermis bodies which the Necrontyr had forged as the full power of the C'tan at last found form. As the C'tan focused their consciousnesses and became ever more aware of their new mode of existence, they came to appreciate the pleasures available to beings of matter and the other realities of corporeal life. The deliciously focused trickles of electromagnetic energy given off by the physical bodies of the Necrontyr all about them awakened a new hunger in the C'tan very unlike the one they had once sated using the nourishing but essentially tasteless energies of the stars.

So it was that one of the C'tan came before the Silent King Szarekh, acting as forerunner to the coming of his brothers. Amongst its own kind, this C'tan was known as the "Deceiver," for it was willfully treacherous. Yet the Silent King knew not the C'tan's true nature, and instead granted the creature an audience. The Deceiver spoke of a war, fought long before the birth of the Necrontyr, between the C'tan and the Old Ones.

It was a war, he said, that the C'tan had lost. In the aftermath, and fearing the vengeance of the Old Ones, he and his brothers had hidden themselves away, hoping one day to find allies with whom they could finally bring the Old Ones to account. In return for this aid, the Deceiver assured, he and his brothers would deliver everything that the Necrontyr craved. Unity could be theirs once again, and the immortality that they had sought for so long would finally be within their grasp. No price would there be for these great gifts, the Deceiver insisted, for they were but boons to be bestowed upon valued allies.

Thus did the Deceiver speak, and who can say how much of his tale was truth? It is doubtful whether even the Deceiver knew, for trickery had become so much a part of his existence that even he could no longer divine its root. Yet his words held sway over Szarekh who, like his ancestors before him, despaired of the divisions that were tearing his people apart.

For long solar months he debated the matter with the other two phaerons of the Triarch and the nobles of his Royal Court. Through it all, the only dissenting voice was that of Orikan, the court astrologer, who foretold that the alliance between the Necrontyr and the C'tan would bring about a renaissance of glory, but destroy forever the soul of the Necrontyr people.

Yet desire and ambition swiftly overrode caution, and Orikan's prophecy was dismissed. A Necrontyr year after the Deceiver had presented his proposition, the Triarch agreed to the alliance, and so forever doomed their race.

For their part, the Necrontyr soon fell into awe of their discoveries and the C'tan moved to take control over their benefactors. The powers of the C'tan manifested in the physical world were indeed almost god-like and it was not long before the C'tan were being worshiped as the Star Gods the Necrontyr had named them.

Perhaps they had been tainted by the material universe they had become a part of, or perhaps this had always been their nature even when they were bound to the suns they fed upon, but the C'tan proved to be as cruel and capricious as the stars from which they had been born. They soon revelled in the worship of the Necrontyr and feasted upon the life energies of countless mortal slaves.

Biotransference and the Rise of the Necrons

"When the Silent King saw what had been done, he knew at last the true nature of the C'tan, and of the doom they had wrought in his name."

— Excerpt from the Book of Mournful Night



The Necron forces on the march during the ancient War in Heaven after biotransference

Armed with weapons of god-like power and starships that could cross the galaxy in the blink of an eye through the use of quantum phase and Dolmen Gate technology, the Necrontyr stood ready to begin their war against the Old Ones anew. But the C'tan had another gift for their mortal subjects. They offered the Necrontyr a path to immortality and the physical stability their race had always craved.

Their diseased flesh would be replaced with the living metal of necrodermis that made up their Star Gods' own physical forms. Their discarded organic husks would be consumed and their cold, metal forms would then be free to pursue their great vengeance against the Old Ones and the rest of a hateful universe, freed forever from the weaknesses of their hated flesh.

With the pact between Necrontyr and C'tan sealed, the Star Gods revealed the form that immortality would take for the Necrontyr, and the great biotransference process began. Colossal bio-furnaces built by Necrontyr artifice roared day and night, consuming weak-bodied flesh and replacing it with enduring machine forms of living metal, much like the C'tan themselves. As the cyclopean machines clamoured, the C'tan swarmed about the biotransference sites, drinking in the torrent of cast-off life energy and growing ever stronger.

Whether the Necrontyr actually realised the price they would actually pay for accepting this pact with the C'tan is not known. The immortality the C'tan promised would be delivered unto the Necrontyr by way of the arcane and terrible process of biotransference. Into the vast bio-furnaces the Silent King's people marched according to the terms of the pact he had made with the C'tan.

What blasphemous procedures the Necrontyr were subjected to within the raging bio-furnaces cannot be known, but certainly, each was stripped of flesh and of soul, their body replaced by a shell of living metal necrodermis animated by what remained of their guttering self. Above each furnace swooped and dove the ethereal true-forms of the C'tan as they glutted themselves on the spiritual detritus of an entire species.

It was only when the Silent King himself emerged from the bio-transference process and looked upon what had become of his people that he saw the awful truth of the pact he had made. Though immortality and nigh godlike strength and vigour were his, it had come at the cost of his soul, the effluvial remains of which had already been sucked down the gullet of a circling C'tan.

As Szarekh watched the C'tan feast on the life essence of his people, he realised the terrible depth of his mistake. In many ways, he felt better than he had in solar decades, the countless aches and uncertainties of organic life now behind him. His new machine body was far mightier than the frail form he had tolerated for so long, and his thoughts were swifter and clearer than they had ever been.

Yet there was an emptiness gnawing at his mind, an inexpressible hollowness of spirit that defied rational explanation. In that moment, he knew with cold certainty that the price of physical immortality had been the loss of his soul. With great sorrow the Silent King beheld the fate he had brought upon his people: the Necrontyr were now but a memory, and the soulless, undying Necrons had been reborn in their place.

Yet if the price had been steep, biotransference had fulfilled all of the promises that the C'tan had made. Even the lowliest of the Necrontyr was now blessed with immortality -- age and hard radiation could little erode their new mechanical bodies, and only the most terrible of injuries could destroy them utterly.

Likewise, the Necrons now enjoyed a unity that the Necrontyr had never known, though it was achieved through tyranny and the complete loss of individuality and emotion rather than by consent. The biotransference process had embedded command protocols in every robotic Necron mind, granting Szarekh the unswerving loyalty of his subjects.

At first, the Silent King embraced this unanimity, for it was a welcome reprieve from the chaos that had consumed the Necrontyr Empire in recent years. However, as time wore on he grew weary of his burden but dared not sever the command protocols, lest his subjects turn on him seeking vengeance for the terrible curse he had visited upon them.

Thus the Necrontyr became the Necrons, cursed to the eternal servitude of their Star Gods. The C'tan feasted upon the entire Necrontyr race's life energies even as they made the transfers, leaving behind only the ghostly echoes of the Necrontyr's consciousnesses. Only a few of the most strong-willed Necrontyr retained their intellect and self-awareness and even they were but shadows of their former selves. They had been purged of so much of what had made them unique individuals.

Yet many of the Necrons who retained their minds cared not at all for their loss; all that mattered to them was that they would live forever without disease or death as their Star Gods had promised. Nevertheless, the Necrontyr species was now united as never before as the new command protocols allowed the Silent King to rule over them with an iron hand. The entire species was his to command, and so it fell upon the Necrons to honour their side of their terrible bargain.

Renewed by their devouring of the souls of an entire species, the C'tan were unstoppable, and with the legions of the Necrons marching in their wake, the Old Ones were doomed. Only one thing truly remained of the old Necrontyr -- their burning hatred for all the other living, intelligent species of the universe.

Legions of the undying living metal warriors set out into the galaxy in their Tomb Ships and the stars burned in their wake. The Old Ones' mastery of the Warp was now countered by the C'tan's supremacy over the physical universe and the ancient enemies of the Necrons suffered greatly in the interstellar slaughter that followed.

Necrons Ascendant

With the C'tan and the Necrons fighting as one, the Old Ones were now doomed to defeat. Glutted on the life force of the Necrontyr, the empowered C'tan were now capable of unleashing forces beyond comprehension. Planets were razed, suns extinguished and whole star systems devoured by black holes called into being by the reality-warping powers of the Star Gods.

Necron legions finally breached the Webway and assailed the Old Ones in every corner of the galaxy. They brought under siege the fortresses of the Old Ones' many allies amongst the younger, intelligent races of the galaxy, harvesting the life force of the defenders to feed their voracious C'tan masters.

In the closing years of the War in Heaven, one of the primary factors that led to the Necrons' ascendancy was their ability to finally gain access to the Old Ones' Webway. The C'tan known as Nyadra'zath, the Burning One, had long desired to carry his eldritch fires into that space beyond space, and so showed the Necrons how to breach its boundaries. Through a series of living stone portals known as Dolmen Gates, the Necrons were finally able to turn the Old Ones' greatest weapon against them, vastly accelerating the ultimate end of the War in Heaven.

The portals offered by the Dolmen Gates are neither so stable, nor so controllable as the naturally occurring entrances to the Webway scattered across the galaxy. Indeed, in some curious fashion, the Webway can detect when its environs have been breached by a Dolmen Gate and its arcane mechanisms swiftly attempt to seal off the infected spur from the rest of the Labyrinth Dimension until the danger to its integrity has passed. Thus, Necrons entering the Webway must reach their intended destination through its shifting extradimensional corridors quickly, lest the network itself bring about their destruction.

Of course, in the present age, aeons have passed since the Necrons used the Dolmen Gates to assault their archenemies. The Old Ones are gone, and the Webway itself has become a tangled and broken labyrinth. Many Dolmen Gates were lost or abandoned during the time of the Necrons' Great Sleep, and many more were destroyed by the Aeldari, the Old Ones' successors as the guardians of the Webway.

Those that remain grant access to but a small portion of the immense maze that is the Webway, much of that voluntarily sealed off by the Aeldari to prevent further contamination. Yet the Webway is immeasurably vast, and even these sundered skeins allow the Necrons a mode of travel that far outpaces those of the younger races.

It is well that this is so. As a race bereft of psykers as a result of the loss of their souls during the biotransference process, the Necrons are also incapable of Warp travel, and without access to the Webway, they would be forced to rely once more on slow-voyaging stasis-ships, dooming them to interstellar isolation.

In the wake of these victories, the C'tan and their undying Necron servants now dominated the galaxy. The last planetary bastions of the Old Ones were besieged and the intelligent races they had once nurtured became cattle for the obscene hunger of the C'tan. To the younger sentient species of the galaxy, the Necrons and their Star Gods were cruel masters, callously harvesting their populations at will to feed the C'tan's ceaseless hunger.

The C'tan were figures of terror who demanded their adoration and fear in equal measure. For unknown reasons, but probably because their individual hungers for mortal life energies knew no bounds, the C'tan ultimately began to fight amongst themselves for both sport and out of spite as they unleashed destructive forces beyond mortal comprehension.

Among the Aeldari, an ancient myth holds that their Laughing God tricked the C'tan known as "The Outsider" into turning on its brothers and beginning their long, fratricidal war for ascendancy. In the course of the C'tan's struggle against one another, whole planets were razed, stars were extinguished and solar systems were devoured by unleashed black holes. New cities were built by the efforts of millions and then smashed down once more. As the "red harvests" of the C'tan and their Necron servants grew thin, C'tan eventually devoured C'tan, until only a few were left in the universe and they competed amongst themselves for a long age.

Eventually, even the Old Ones, who had once been defined by their patience and unstoppable will, became desperate in the face of the Necron assault. They used their great scientific skills to genetically engineer intelligent beings with an even stronger psychic link to the Warp, hoping to create servants with the capability of channeling psychic power to defend themselves.

They nurtured many potential warrior races, among which are believed to be the earliest members of the Aeldari species and many other xenos races, including the Rashan, the K'nib, the Krork and many others. Millennia passed as the Old Ones' creations finally bore fruit and the C'tan and their Necron servants continued to extinguish life across the galaxy.

The Tide Turns

The Old Ones' psychically-empowered servant races spread across the galaxy, battling the advanced Necron technology with the psychic power of their Warp-spawned sorcery. Facing this new onslaught, the C'tan's empire was shattered, as the psychic forces of the Immaterium were anathema to soulless entities whose existence was wholly contained within purely physical patterns of electromagnetic force. For all the destruction they could unleash, they were unable to stop the Old Ones and the younger races' relentless advance across the stars.

The C'tan, unified by this great threat for the first time in millions of Terran years, sought a way to defeat the soul-fuelled energies of the younger species. They initiated a great warding, a plan to forever defeat the psychic sorceries of the Old Ones by sealing off the local region of the material universe from the Warp, a plan whose first fruits could once be found on the Imperial Fortress World of Cadia in the form of the great blackstone pylons that littered the surface of that world in intricate networks and created the area of space-time stability near the Eye of Terror known as the Cadian Gate.

With their god-like powers, it was only a matter of time until the C'tan succeeded and the greatest work of the C'tan was begun. But before it was complete, the seeds of destruction the Old Ones had planted millennia before brought about an unforeseen cataclysm. The growing pains and collective psychic flaws of the younger races threw the untapped, psychically-reactive energies of the Immaterium into disorder. War, pain and destruction were mirrored in the bottomless depth of the Sea of Souls that was the Warp.

The maelstrom of souls unleashed into the Immaterium by the carnage of the War in Heaven coalesced in the previously formless psychic energies of the Warp. Older entities that had existed within the Immaterium transformed into terrifying psychic predators, tearing at the souls of vulnerable psykers as their own environment was torn apart and reforged into the hellish dimension later called the Realm of Chaos.

Enslaver Plague

The denizens of the Warp clustered voraciously at the cracks between the Immaterium and the material universe, seeking new ways to enter the physical realm. The Old Ones brought forth more new genetically-engineered warrior races to defend their last strongholds, including the technology-mimicking Jokaero and the formidable, green-skinned Krork who were the ancestors of the present day Orks, but it was already too late.

The Old Ones' interstellar Webway network was breached from the Immaterium and lost to them. Several of their Warp Gates were destroyed by their own hands to prevent the entities of the Warp from spreading to uncorrupted worlds. The Old Ones' greatest works and places of power were soon overrun by the horrors their own creations had unleashed.

The most terrifying of these horrors were the Enslavers, Warp-dwelling entities whose ability to dominate the minds of the younger races and create their own portals into the material realm using transmuted, possessed psykers brought them forth in ever-greater numbers.

For the Old Ones, this was the final disaster as the Enslavers took control of their servants. The Pandora's Box unleashed by the creation of the younger races finally scattered the last of the Old Ones and broke their power over the galaxy once and for all. Life had stood at the edge of an apocalypse during the War in Heaven between the Old Ones and the C'tan. Now as the Enslavers breached the Immaterium in epidemic proportions, the survivors looked doomed.

Ultimately, beset by the implacable onset of the C'tan and the calamitous Warp-spawned perils they had themselves unleashed, the Old Ones were defeated, scattered and finally destroyed. Whether the species went extinct or simply fled the galaxy to seek a new haven elsewhere is unknown.

Silent King's Betrayal

Throughout the final stages of the War in Heaven, the Silent King Szarekh bided his time, waiting for the moment in which the C'tan would prove vulnerable. Though the entire Necron race was now his to command, he could not hope to oppose the C'tan at the height of their power, and even if he did and met with success, the Necrons would then have to finish the War in Heaven against the Old Ones and their increasingly potent allies alone.

No, the Old Ones had to be completely and utterly defeated before the C'tan could be brought to account for the horror they had wrought. And so, when the C'tan finally won their great war, their triumph proved short-lived. With one hated enemy finally defeated, and the other spent from hard-fought victory, the Silent King at last led the Necrons in revolt against their C'tan masters.

In their arrogance, the C'tan did not realise their danger until it was too late. The Necrons focused the unimaginable energies of the living universe into weapons, god-killing hypercannons devised by the finest Crypteks in the galaxy, too mighty for even the Star Gods to endure. Not even the great overlords of the Necron crownworlds well remember the battles against the Star Gods, for causality itself was damaged by the forces unleashed to dismember the C'tan, and the Silent King removed the knowledge of the dreadful weapons that had been employed from his warriors' minds after the fact in fear of what might later be done with them.

Alas, the C'tan were immortal star-spawn, part of the fundamental fabric of reality and therefore nigh-impossible to destroy. So was each C'tan instead sundered into thousands of smaller and less-powerful fragments with a similar energy signature. Yet this was sufficient to the Silent King's goals. Indeed, he had known the C'tan's ultimate destruction to be impossible and had drawn his plans accordingly; each of these "C'tan Shards" was bound within a multidimensional Tesseract Labyrinth, as trammelled and secured as a Terran djinn trapped in a bottle.

Though the cost of victory was high -- millions of Necrons had been destroyed as a consequence of the rebellion, including all of the members of the Triarch save the Silent King himself -- the Necrons were once more in command of their own destiny.

C'tan Shards

"Verminous beasts poured through the breach in their multitudes, dragging my warriors down and peeling open their metal bodies. It was then that I ordered the C'tan set loose, for I would not lose another servant to these base creatures. N'phoran the Spiral Flame emerged upon the battlefield in an explosion of blinding light. It raised a hand dismissively, and in an instant a score of scuttling beasts were unmade, transmuted into a cloud of dust and scattered atoms. Aliens swarmed over the C'tan's blazing form, bodies melting away even as they tried in vain to breach its necrodermis. One of the aliens' weapon-beasts hove into view, its spine glowing with phosphorescent light as it prepared to fire its organic cannon. N'phoran clenched a fist, and a meteor of black fire burst from its outstretched hand and struck the monster's head, crushing its skull in an explosion of bone and ichor."

— Nemesor Yhardusz, the Spear of Karsa



A C'tan Shard unleashed upon a horde of Tyranids.

A C'tan Shard is all that remains of the once mighty Star Gods of Necron antiquity. They are now only echoes of their former selves, splinters of energy that survived their Necron servants' ancient betrayal and were enslaved in turn. Most now languish in unbreakable servitude to their former vassals, utterly incapable of acting without commission.

Should a C'tan Shard rebel, or a fault develop in its control relays, then fail-safe mechanisms automatically activate, whisking the creature back to its tomb, there to languish for long Terran centuries until times are dire enough that the Necrons must call upon its services again.

Even with these precautions, the Necrons are wary of employing C'tan Shards in battle. Though the chance of escape is remote, the possibility remains, so the day must be dark indeed for the Necron cause before the Tesseract Labyrinths are opened and the C'tan unleashed upon the galaxy once again. In the 41st Millennium, the foes of the Necrons have so far only encountered two types of C'tan Shard, those of Aza'gorod the Nightbringer and Mephet'ran the Deceiver.

Even now in their reduced and wholly fettered state, C'tan Shards are beings of near-unlimited power. They can manifest energy blasts, control the minds of lesser beings, manipulate the flow of time, and banish foes to alternate dimensions. Indeed, a C'tan Shard's abilities are limited only by two things: its imagination -- which is immense -- and glimmering memories of the being from which it was severed.

Whilst no individual C'tan Shard has full recall of the omnipotent being it once was, each carries the personality and hubris of that vaster and more puissant being. Though a C'tan Shard has the power to reduce a tank to molten slag with but a gesture, it might simply not occur to it to do so, as its gestalt primogenitor would have tackled the situation through other means, such as by devolving the crew into primordial ooze, or deceiving them into attacking their own allies.

The only hope of defeating a C'tan is to breach its necrodermis shell -- the living metal form that cages its energetic essence. If the necrodermis is compromised, the C'tan Shard explodes in a pulse of blinding energy, its being scattered to the galactic solar winds.

Whilst it is true that many C'tan Shards are now indentured to Necron service, this by no means accounts for the entire pantheon of C'tan. Rumours of C'tan-like beings can be found across the galaxy, though many are merely entities that exhibit inexplicable, reality-warping powers.

Indeed, any such being -- whether Warp-spawned Daemon, energy-based life form or an alien with advanced technology -- can be mistaken for a C'tan if the observer is primitive, credulous or simply ill-informed enough. This discrepant information causes great confusion concerning the exact number and nature of the surviving C'tan, even among the Aeldari.

Records held in the Black Library contradict those maintained on Ulthwé, which are again at odds with the archives held on Alaitoc. There might be four C'tan at present in the galaxy, four thousand or any number in between.

However, all Aeldari agree that the splinters of knowledge held by the Imperium of Man are so flawed and confused that they, if anything, move further from the truth with each fresh discovery made. Any who go looking for proof of a C'tan's existence can easily uncover it, but this speaks more to the mindset of the searcher than it does to any value of the "evidence."

Transcendent C'tan



A Transcendent C'tan

Transcendent C'tan are the most dangerous of their kind amongst the C'tan Shards. Each is an aggregation of anywhere between a dozen and a hundred lesser C'tan Shards, and its power far surpasses the sum of its parts.

Those few that are chained to Necron service are not contained by Tesseract Labyrinths, but by energy shackles designed aeons ago by the legendary Necron artificer Svarokh.

Such devices are unstable, making the deployment of a Transcendent C'tan without the device known as a Tesseract Vault to contain it something of a risk, only undertaken in times of direst need. For this reason, when contained within a Tesseract Vault, a Transcendent C'tan is also kept within a special energy shield generated by a robotic Necron construct known as a Canoptek Sentinel.

Canoptek Sentinels are used to control the raw elemental energies of a Transcendent C'tan. The Sentinel draws from the Transcendent C'tan's own power to generate a force shield strong enough to keep the C'tan shackled to the mechanisms of the Tesseract Vault.

At the same time, constructs known as Canoptek Leeches arrayed and docked around the circumference of the vault and an army of Canoptek Scarabs move to constantly repair the damage done to the arcane prison.

However, there are only so many Scarabs and Canoptek Leeches holding the Tesseract Vault together, and as the Transcendent C'tan bends reality and tears metal off the vault in its bids for freedom, the Canoptek automatons rebuild its prison using the debris in a cyclical process of destruction and reconstruction.

Powers of the C'tan

To the shards of the C'tan, reality is merely another weapon to be turned against their foes. It is within the prodigious powers of the god-fragments to summon forth storms of annihilating negative matter, shatter the foundation of a planet, or cast their enemies out of existence with but a thought.

The abilities of C'tan Shards are many and varied, often harking back to those their far more powerful parent-entities enjoyed.

A C'tan Shard is always capable of unleashing two of the following abilities, whose use has been previously recorded by Aeldari scholars. It is likely that this represents only a fraction of the reality-warping abilities available to a C'tan Shard.

Antimatter Meteor - The C'tan Shard gathers an orb of roiling antimatter, before hurling the crackling projectile into the midst of the foe.

Cosmic Fire - At the C'tan Shard's gestured command, a pillar of black fire streaks down from the heavens to consume the foe.

Entropic Touch - Metal decays on contact with the C'tan Shard's rotten grasp.

Gaze of Death - Eyes blazing with dark energy, the C'tan Shard drains the life from all in the vicinity.

Grand Illusion - The C'tan Shard weaves a glamour of deception, preventing the foe from seeing the true disposition of the Necron forces.

Lord of Fire - The C'tan Shard that wields this ability can become a creature of living flame, able to command the fires wielded by the enemy. This makes all Flamer weapons (as well as heat rays, Burnas, Skorchas, Inferno Cannons and any other weapon that uses flame or fire), as well as all Melta Weapons fired near the C'tan Shard explode at the C'tan's whim.

Moulder of Worlds - Tortured rock buckles and heaves, showering the C'tan Shard's foes with boulders.

Pyreshards - The C'tan Shard conjures specks of blazing black matter and directs them against its foes.

Seismic Assault - Stone fractures and ores melt as the C'tan Shard drags up tides of magma from deep below a world's crust.

Sky of Fallen Stars - Savagely beautiful orbs of coruscating light plummet from the cold depths of space, growing to roaring bale-stars as they approach.

Sentient Singularity - The C'tan Shard's presence destabilizes all local gravitational forces, disrupting engines, teleport beams and Warp jumps.

Swarm of Spirit Dust - A cloud of swirling darkness conceals the C'tan Shard from the gaze of its foes.

Time's Arrow - Mutating the flow of causation and remoulding the temporal stream of the space-time continuum, the C'tan Shard casts its foe back into the darkness from before time was time, erasing them from existence as if they had never been.

Transdimensional Thunderbolt - The C'tan Shard projects a bolt of crackling transdimensional energy from its outstretched palm, blasting its foe into oblivion.

Writhing Worldscape - The natural world revolts at the C'tan Shard's presence, the very ground writhing and shaking as the physical laws of reality are undone.

Ascendant Powers

A Transcendent C'tan is a far more powerful entity than a standard C'tan Shard. As such, Transcendent C'tan are able to unleash these abilities when the Necrons deign to release them upon the battlefield. Every Transcendent C'tan must possess one of the following powers, though they cannot be unleashed when the C'tan is fully shackled within the confines of the Tesseract Vault:

Storm of Heavenly Fire - The Transcendent C'tan unleashes a rain of fire from the heavens which explodes with a cataclysmic blast upon the battlefield. This power is extremely effective at destroying enemy tanks and armoured vehicles.

Transliminal Stride - The Transcendent C'tan can move across the battlefield to a predetermined point, simply phasing through all obstacles or opponents in its path, weakening them as its passes through.

Seismic Shockwave - When the Transcendent C'tan slams its necrodermis-clad foot down, it unleashes a seismic shockwave that causes the very ground to shake, blasting armoured vehicles and infantry alike into the air like unfortunate toys.

A Transcendent C'tan is able to manifest two of the following Ascendant Powers, and can utilise them to devastating effect on the battlefield:

Antimatter Meteor - The Transcendent C'tan is able to unleash a huge meteor composed of antimatter upon the battlefield, a furious assault from the sky that will annihilate all normal matter within range.

Cosmic Fire - The Transcendent C'tan unleashes a wave of fire hotter than the interior of some suns upon the battlefield, incinerating everything in its path.

Seismic Assault - The Transcendent C'tan causes rumbling earthquakes with a flick of its hand, crushing enemy units to pulp.

Sky of Falling Stars - A rain of blazing meteorites falls from the sky to impact the foe at the whim of the Transcendent C'tan.

Transdimensional Maelstrom - The Transcendent C'tan uses its command of transdimensional energies to unleash a swirling extradimensional vortex upon the battlefield that can banish all it touches to an alternate reality.

Wave of Withering - The Transcendent C'tan can cause metal and flesh alike to wither at its command.

Notable C'tan

Active C'tan

Those C'tan who are known to still exist include:

Aza'gorod the Nightbringer - Aza'gorod the Nightbringer has impressed its image as that of the grim reaper itself on the psyche of the younger races, apart from the Orks (since they do not fear death). Upon entering stasis it was almost destroyed and starved but was released by Kashmir De Valtos, a corrupt planetary administrator in the Imperium of Man in the 41st Millennium, which caused the Necrons to begin to awaken from their ancient sleep.

Mephet'ran the Deceiver - Mephet'ran the Deceiver came out of stasis an unknown time ago and has been weaving plots ever since, including the destruction of the ancient Old Ones weapons the Aeldari call the Talismans of Vaul and the Imperium knows as the Blackstone Fortresses which were designed to destroy the C'tan on their emergence.

Mag'ladroth the Void Dragon - Mag'ladroth the Void Dragon is the most powerful C'tan and still resides in stasis, theorised to be located beneath Mars in the Noctis Labyrinthus. The Void Dragon is believed by some Tech-priests to be the actual Machine God venerated by the Cult of the Machine of the Adeptus Mechanicus. A master of the material realm, this particular C'tan was a figure of oblivion, devastation and wanton destruction and its created warriors were nigh invincible. No C'tan Shard of this C'tan has yet been encountered, and it is possible that the Void Dragon has remained whole through the eons and its essence was never captured within the Tesseract Labyrinths. This is a truly terrifying prospect for the galaxy if this entity were to awaken.

N'phoran the Spiral Flame - The C'tan Shard of N'phoran was unleashed by the Nemesor Yhardusz in a battle between the Necrons and the Tyranids.

Nyadra'zatha the Burning One - It was the C'tan known as Nyadra'zatha, the Burning One, who had long desired to carry his eldritch fires into the Webway and beyond, who enabled the Necrons to gain access to the Labyrinth Dimension, showing the Necrons how to breach its boundaries. Through a series of living stone portals known as Dolmen Gates, the Necrons have finally been able to turn the Old Ones' greatest weapon to their own purpose. As a race bereft of psykers, the Necrons are incapable of Warp travel, and without access to the Webway, they would be forced to rely once more on slow-voyaging stasis-ships, dooming them to isolation within the galaxy.

Zarhulash the Potentate - A shard of Zarhulash the Potentate was used to power one of the eight Necron Warp beacons known as the Pharos on the world of Sotha in the Ultima Segmentum. The Pharos was built of blackstone, and the array of Pharos devices was originally intended by the Necrons to provide a way for them to achieve rapid interstellar communications and FTL travel. The birth of the Great Rift that bisected the galaxy at the start of the Era Indomitus reactivated the Pharos. This was discovered by the Scythes of the Emperor Chapter, who still guarded the world after its destruction by a Genestealer Cult infestation and Hive Fleet Kraken during the Second Tyrannic War. Archmagos Dominus Belisarius Cawl led an expedition to Sotha with the aid of the Ultramarines and the remaining Firstborn Space Marines of the Scythes of the Emperor to study and perhaps use the Pharos' technology to close the Great Rift and defeat Chaos. The expedition came under assault by Genestealer Cultists who had infiltrated the Chapter serfs of the Scythes of the Emperor. Ultimately all of that Chapter's remaining Firstborn Marines were slain alongside their Chapter Master Thracius in combat with the Genestealer Patriarch whose cult had first called Hive Fleet Kraken to destroy Sotha. After reaching the Pharos, Cawl discovered that a shard of Zarhulash had provided the power source for the ancient Pharos. He forged a deal with the alien star god, in which Zarhulash agreed to destroy the device by removing its heart, creating a miniature singularity. In exchange, Cawl agreed to remove the shackles of necrodermis that kept the C'tan Shard captive and create a portal with the Pharos to allow him to finally escape from Sotha. Cawl seemingly agreed, but this was only a ruse as he actually teleported Zarhulash to a far-off region of the galaxy where the C'tan Shard was surrounded by hostile Necron Tomb Worlds. Zarhulash swore revenge on Cawl for this betrayal.

Inactive or Unknown Status

The names of several other C'tan are known to the Imperium of Man and the Aeldari, though they have not yet been encountered as active C'tan Shards and it remains unknown whether they still exist in Necron captivity like their brethren or have ceased to exist.

Iash'uddra the Endless Swarm - Nothing is currently known about this C'tan, other than that it exists.

Kalugura - Kalugura is a C'tan who was captured and transformed into a C'tan Shard. Kalugura was once a horrific engine of destruction. This particular C'tan Shard was entombed on the world of Kalugura aeons ago, at the command of the Silent King Szarekh, then the supreme overlord of the Necron race's ruling Triarch. The reason why this Shard was imprisoned and is no longer deployed by the Necrons is unknown.

Llandu'gor, the Flayer - When the Necrons finally turned against the C'tan in the last days of the War in Heaven, the Flayer was not simply splintered as were his brothers, but utterly obliterated. In his dying moments, the Star God inflicted a terrible curse upon the Necrons, tainting them with an echo of the fathomless hunger of its essence. The victims of this terrible madness are the Flayed Ones.

Og'driada, the Arisen - Nothing is currently known about this C'tan, other than that it exists.

Tsara'noga the Outsider - Tsara'noga the Outsider became insane due to its consumption of other C'tan, a trick played on it by Cegorach, the Aeldari Laughing God. It developed a hellish presence, causing madness in all who came close, and many killed themselves rather than have to face the Outsider. The Outsider shares some similarities with the Nightbringer, in that it is said that to look upon it would cause terror, much like the Nightbringer's infusion of terror in the younger races produced by the Old Ones. Furthermore, one of the Harlequins' many dances depicts the moment when the Laughing God tricked the C'tan into consuming each other, except that the C'tan depicted is the Nightbringer, rather than the Outsider. The Outsider is currently imprisoned in a Dyson Sphere located beneath the galactic plane. The Harlequins whisper that "one dark night, it shall return."



Imperial forces focus their fire upon the Tesseract Vault holding a C'tan Shard of Yggra'nya during the Second Battle of Damnos in 999.M41.

Yggra'nya, the World Shaper - Yggra'nya is also known as the "World Shaper," the "Moulder of Worlds" and the "Worldmaker." The World Shaper's thoughts can break apart planets and reshape them into forms more pleasing to itself. A shard of this C'tan powered the planetoid-sized mobile Necron Tomb World called Borsis, the "World Engine." Prior to the Silent King Szarekh's betrayal of the C'tan during the closing days of the War in Heaven, Yggra'nya was the patron deity of Borsis, the World Engine. During the days when it still ruled Borsis it had manifested as a being with skin of multi-coloured flame. Its form then possessed several pairs of arms, each carrying a symbol of rulership: a sceptre, an orb, a sword, and the jaw of a spacefaring beast. Topping its three-eyed face was a headdress of gold and deep blue. Borsis was one of many worlds Yggra'nya controlled when the C'tan ruled the Necrontyr as their star gods. Like other C'tan, it was shattered into C'tan Shards when the Silent King betrayed the star gods in the closing days of the War in Heaven. In 912.M41, the Nephrekh Dynasty Necron Lords Turakhin and Heqiroth overthrew the Magadha Dynasty Necron Overlord who ruled the crownworld of Borsis and activated the World Engine. The World Engine, powered by a great shard of Yggra'nya, made its way to Mars, destroying any Imperial worlds in its path, with the intent of awakening the the C'tan known as the Void Dragon. Heqiroth had also stolen the living metal skin of Yggra'nya, declaring himself a god. During this time, the shard of Yggra'nya mentally contacted Brother Ghazin of the Astral Knights, who were desperately battling the World Engine alongside other Space Marine Chapters. Yggra'nya and Turakhin both assisted the Astral Knights in return for their freedom and to bring down the now-mad Heqiroth, respectively. Yggra'nya appeared in a vision to the Astral Knights' Chief Librarian Hyalhi. It took on an emaciated form composed of grey matter, wearing a tattered headdress of gold, dull oval eyes of crackled amber, and an empty mounting for missing gemstones. It raged against the betrayal of the Necrons, believing there was no fault in what the C'tan had offered to the Necrontyr when they had traded their souls for their undying necrodermis bodies in the biotransference process. Yggra'nya offered to destroy Borsis in exchange for assistance from the Imperials in freeing it from its prison. It claimed that it would simply leave the galaxy afterwards to find a new home whose inhabitants would prove more appreciative of its gifts. After destroying Borsis, it fulfilled its promise to disappear, but Inquisitor Lord Quilven Rhaye had made his own pledge to Chief Librarian Hyalhi to find and destroy Yggra'nya. In 999.M41, during the Second Battle of Damnos, another shard of Yggra'nya was deployed by the Necons against the assaulting Imperial forces. After the Ultramarines under the command of Chapter Master Marneus Calgar reached a stalemate with the Necrons on Damnos, a psychic communication from Chief Librarian Varro Tigurius informed Calgar of the nature of the Tesseract Vault that was being used to attack the Imperial positions. Calgar ordered his forces to focus their fire upon the Tesseract Vault, which when destroyed release a C'tan Shard of Yggra'nya. The shard of the World Shaper proceeded to wreak havoc upon the Necrons, the Imperials, and the world of Damnos itself. This shard of Yggra'nya opened vast subterranean chasms across the planet, destroying most of the Necron and Imperial forces. With the tide turned against the Necrons, the Ultramarines 2nd Company Captain Cato Sicarius hurled a Vortex Grenade at the shard of the World Shaper. Turning its horned head to leer at Sicarius, the C'tan shard summoned a giant fist shaped of bedrock from the ground to grasp the Ultramarine captain. Just as the fist began to close upon Sicarius to crush him, the vortex grenade detonated, sucking the C'tan Shard into the Warp.

Other C'tan Influences

The Imperial Inquisition employs elite Officio Assassinorum assassins, among whom the members of the Callidus Temple use a weapon called a C'tan Phase Sword. It is unknown what specific relation the weapon has with the C'tan themselves. The most likely explanation would be that the C'tan Phase Sword is made out of necrodermis, such as in one instance where a Callidus Assassin attacked an Imperial planetary governor, only to have her C'tan phase weapon absorbed into the "governor" and become a part of his body. This governor was most likely the C'tan called the Deceiver in another of its myriad disguises.

The primary weakness of the C'tan is their inability to comprehend the Warp. It is speculated that they find it impossible to survive in it and are particularly susceptible as a result to Warp-spawned psychic powers and the psykers who wield them.

It is also speculated that they worked with the Necrons to construct the networks of blackstone pylons on Cadia and elsewhere across the galaxy, with the likely intention of sealing off the local area of realspace (i.e. the galaxy) from the Immaterium. Whether these pylons have anything to do with the existence of the nearby Eye of Terror is unknown, but it is unlikely, as the Eye was not opened until long after the Necrons were already in their stasis tombs.

There is also a Necron object of unknown purpose on the Hive World of Armageddon in the Equatorial Jungle regions of the planet.

This pseudo-code provides a foundation for representing C'tan and their shards in a Python program. It includes basic attributes, methods for shattering and absorbing shards, and a framework for simulating their abilities. You can further develop this structure to create a more comprehensive simulation of the C'tan and their role in the Warhammer 40k universe.
